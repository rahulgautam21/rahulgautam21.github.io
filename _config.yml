  Hi, my name's Rahul Gautam and I'm a Computer Science Graduate Student at North Carolina State University. My passion lies in developing scalable software solutions to real world problems so that we can make our lives less mundane and spend more time on interesting problems like astrophysics and climate change.

  Currently I am looking for <mark>Software Developer opportunities</mark> as I am graduating in <mark>December 2022</mark>.
  
  I have 3 years of work experience working as a Full-Stack developer at Morgan Stanley and then as an intern at Aloft Appraisal. I was part of the collateral team at Morgan Stanley and was responsible for the development of the Loan Estimation software that is used by thousands of financial advisors. At Aloft Appraisal I was responsible for developing a pricing tool to predict the price of an appraisal based on complexity of the property. I have experience designing scalable systems and am proficient in Java, React, Spring Framework, and SQL.

          Used different machine models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and KNN) for predicting weather anamolies on NC State Climate Data. Handled imbalanced data by using nearest neighborhood cleaning under-sampling while training. Achieved an F-1 score of 0.95 and a recall of 1

          Built an application to mine bioinformatics tools from scientific journals and map them to their use-cases based on the papers that they cite and the content of the paper. Sometimes common bioinformatics tool names are words out of the English dictionary like STAR and Salmon. These words are called homonyms. Used an SVM classifier to distinguish the bioinformatics tool detected from a homonym of the word with an accuracy of 97%.
